Hi! I'm primarily a Stardew Valley modder doing Content Patcher and Shop Tile Framework mods. I enjoy messing a bit with shops.

I decided during the pandemic that none of the shop mods were really doing what I wanted in my game, which was make Community Center completion a bit easier (though not too easy). Thus, Hat Mouse Extra was born and posted under my NexusMods username, Ravenhyde. Even though my GitHub username is different, I'm sticking with Ravenhyde for my mod author name.

With the jump to Stardew Valley 1.6, I've moved to writing Content Patcher framework mods. Currently up are Raven's Tiny Shop Additions and Raven's Slightly Easier Combat. I have several more mods completed that I just have to upload here, and I'm working on revising Raven's Slightly Easier Combat to work in languages other than English. My mods are tested on a Linux PC and also on Android to make sure they work.

To be uploaded:
- Raven's Brighter Ladder, which slightly brightens the ladder in levels 31-39 of the mines.
- Raven's Mystery Box Exchanger, which creates a new machine that swaps mystery boxes for mostly community center completion items.
- Raven's Ore Swapper, which is another buildable machine that may give you a more difficult to get ore... or it may not.
- Raven's Quick Seed Exchanger, which is yet another buildable machine that, when given mixed seeds, outputs a seed packet for either the current season or the next one.
- Raven's Truffle Crab Spot, which slightly alters the truffle crab to make it distingishable from a standard truffle.
